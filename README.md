# Hi there 👋

I’m passionate about building impactful technology and creating products that solve real-world problems. My journey has taken me through entrepreneurship, product management, and strategic consulting, always with a strong focus on innovation.

## 🚀 About Me

- **Product & Tech Enthusiast**: During Le Wagon, I pitched and led the development of **Trendal.me**, a platform aggregating trending TikTok and YouTube content for brands and creators. Awarded **Best Project**, it's now the most upvoted project on their platform.
- **Entrepreneurial Spirit**: I co-founded **Derby des Parisiennes**, bringing together HEC, ESSEC, and ESCP in a sports tournament that expanded to top engineering schools, becoming a flagship event.
- **Strategic Thinker**: At Kearney, I mastered solving complex problems under pressure. At Colonies, I raised with my team **€150M in investments**, refining my ability to execute high-stakes deals.
- **Builder of Impactful Products**: I’m currently developing **Keeply.tech**, an app that centralizes receipts, tracks belongings, and manages warranties. Exploring **blockchain applications**, I'm working on digital ownership certificates to revolutionize warranty claims and resale markets.

## 🌍 Areas That Excite Me

- **Entertainment & Adtech**: AI-driven game customization and AI-generated ad campaigns have untapped potential to disrupt traditional industries.
- **Blockchain & Transparency**: Leveraging blockchain for **traceable ownership certificates** to enhance consumer confidence and resale value.

## 🔥 My Philosophy

Success isn't about having all the answers—it's about testing ideas relentlessly, embracing uncertainty, and iterating quickly. Whether launching Trendal.me or securing investments at Colonies, adaptability and resilience have been key.
